			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider breaking down the CI/CD pipeline setup into more granular steps, such as environment configuration, secret management, and deployment strategy.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves setting up a GitHub repository and configuring a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. While the subtasks are well-defined, the complexity arises from ensuring the pipeline is robust and handles various scenarios like pull requests and merges. The technical challenge is moderate, with dependencies primarily on the correct configuration of GitHub Actions."
